# mame-ipac-emulator

  Use an Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro (or similar) to emulate an
  Ultimarc I-PAC/J-PAC (https://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html) like
  keyboard input for connecting arcade controls to a PC/Raspberry Pi/SBC etc.
  running M.A.M.E.
  
  Note: This is not a complete emulation nor is it programable like the
  real thing.  If you have the money, buy the real thing. If you want to tinker
  and have a spare suitable Arduino device sitting idle, or want the cheapest
  solution possible, then this might work for you.
